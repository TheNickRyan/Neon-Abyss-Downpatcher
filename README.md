# Neon Abyss Downpatcher
A useful tool for downpatching to any version of the game.

## ** THIS TOOL IS DEPRECATED AND NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL. **

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/TheNickRyan/Neon-Abyss-Downpatcher/releases), and run the `Neon Abyss Downpatcher.exe`. Once the program opens, browse for the main game folder (should be the default directory `C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Neon Abyss`), then select a Manifest number.

### Manifests and Versions
There are >150 Manifests for Neon Abyss, and only a few have a known version to them currently. They will get updated often as we source them out, but if you choose to play an unknown version then PLEASE write down your Manifest number and version if you can. You can reply to the [Issue](https://github.com/TheNickRyan/Neon-Abyss-Downpatcher/issues/1) or join the [Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6FarHA3) and post it there!

### Downpatcher uses DepotDownloader
You can find the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader). There have been no changes to the code, it is a very useful tool to download the files using manifests and steamdb. Thanks to [SteamRE](https://github.com/SteamRE) for a fantastic tool.
